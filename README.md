# unity-shader

This was a simple little project I made because there was no existing way to apply the multiple textures I needed to a model in a project I was working on. It modifies existing albedo texture properties to inherit a second input texture file. It then overlays this texture on top of the existing texture and has sliders to manipulate its transparency and other minor settings.
